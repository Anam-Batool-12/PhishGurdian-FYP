# Final Year Project Report – Hardware Integration

## 1. Scope

This project not only detects phishing URLs using a rule-based approach but also integrates an Arduino-based hardware simulation to provide real-time physical feedback (LEDs and buzzer) for enhanced user awareness.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

* **FR-01:** The system shall allow users to input a URL.
* **FR-02:** The system shall analyze the URL against defined phishing detection rules.
* **FR-03:** The system shall store detection logs in a database.
* **FR-04:** The system shall display detection results in the frontend.
* **FR-05:** The system shall provide quiz-based cyber awareness training.
* **FR-06:** The system shall generate reports and visualizations of detection results.
* **FR-07:** The system shall provide a user-friendly interface.
* **FR-08:** The system shall trigger Arduino hardware components (green LED for safe, red LED + buzzer for phishing).
* **FR-09:** The hardware feedback shall synchronize with the detection results in the web application.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

* The system must provide results within 2 seconds.
* The system should be lightweight and run on low-end hardware.
* The database must ensure persistent storage.
* The hardware feedback must occur within 2 seconds of phishing detection.
* The system should work even if hardware is not connected (via simulation fallback).

---

## 4. Hardware Requirements

* Arduino Uno R3
* Breadboard
* Green LED, Red LED
* Buzzer
* Jumper Wires, Resistors
* USB cable for PC–Arduino communication

> In absence of real Arduino hardware, the project uses a Python-based hardware simulation module (`hardware.py`) that mimics LED and buzzer feedback via console outputs.

---

## 5. System Workflow

**User enters URL → Flask App processes with rules.py → Result sent to frontend → Hardware.py / Arduino board triggered → Red/Green LED + buzzer indicate result.**

---

## 6. Use Case: Hardware Feedback

* **Actor:** User
* **Precondition:** User has entered a URL.
* **Flow:**

  1. System checks the URL.
  2. If phishing → Red LED + buzzer.
  3. If safe → Green LED lights up.
* **Postcondition:** User gets visual + auditory alert in real-time.

---

## 7. Implementation

* Python’s Flask framework handles URL input and phishing detection.
* The function `indicate_url_status(status)` inside `hardware.py` simulates or controls the Arduino hardware.
* When the result is phishing, it triggers a buzzer sound and red LED. For safe, it triggers green LED.

## 8. Prototype vs. Final Hardware Integration

At the current prototype stage, the hardware feedback is **simulated in software**. The `hardware.py` module prints feedback messages such as “Green LED ON” or “Red LED + Buzzer activated” to mimic the behavior of the physical circuit.

In the final deliverable, this simulation will be replaced by a real **Arduino Uno circuit** connected via USB. Python will send commands (`S` for Safe, `P` for Phishing) over serial communication, and the Arduino will control the LEDs and buzzer accordingly. This ensures that the transition from prototype to real hardware requires minimal changes in the code.

## 9. Testing

| **Test ID** | **Input URL**                                      | **Expected Result** | **Hardware Feedback** | **Pass/Fail** |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| T-01        | [http://phishy-login.com](http://phishy-login.com) | Phishing Detected   | Red LED + Buzzer      | Pass          |
| T-02        | [https://google.com](https://google.com)           | Safe                | Green LED             | Pass          |
| T-03        | Invalid URL                                        | Invalid URL message | No hardware activity  | Pass          |

## 10. Future Work

In final deliverable, the hardware can be embedded into a USB security key for real-time phishing detection, where the device lights up or buzzes independently without requiring a computer screen.
